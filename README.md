# GOLS
We compare Gradient-Only Line Searches that are Inexact to Probabilistic Line searches (Mahsereci and Hennig, 2017, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02846.pdf) in determining step sizes for neural networks using dynamic mini-batch sub-sampling.
Based on the paper "Gradient-only line searches: An Alternative to Probabilistic Line Searches" by Kafka and Wilke, 2019.
